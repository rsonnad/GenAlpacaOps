      Please, Please, Please read these "Rules & Instructions"<br>
      and please don't enter until you do...
    </p>

    <p>At the Austin Alpaca Playhouse our mission is to let your Alpaca Dreams run free. Our goal is to redefine your idea of what an Alpaca Playhouse can be.</p>

    <p>To make this all work, we have a few <strong>critical</strong> requests:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Always, Always, Always keep the back fence gates closed.</strong> Don't leave them open for a second or the Alpaca will wonder off, and you may spend the rest of your life chasing lost alpaca dreams.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>PARKING: Please follow signs and Respect Neighborhood Sovereignty.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>DO NOT park in front of neighbors houses.</li>
          <li>DO NOT park on the grass.</li>
          <li>When you come in the gate, you can park in the gravel lot on the right when you come in, if it is not full already. Park facing either the street or the container - and near other cars - don't be a space <strong>hog</strong>. We are not a hog playhouse. Do that stuff somewhere else.</li>
          <li>If there is no space in the lot you can park across the street to the left past two houses, facing the highway - (NOT IN FRONT OF A HOUSE) or if there is no room there, you can park on the frontage road (turn left before the highway) and then park to the right of the signs that say "no parking to the left". This is 5 minute walk.</li>
          <li>DO NOT PARK OR DRIVE ANYWHERE ON THE GRASS beyond the gate. There are Sprinklers that may get damaged, and you are likely to get stuck in the mud if it has rained. It's a $200 towing bill.</li>
          <li>Don't ever park your car on the circle or by the garage. This obstructs Amazon delivery access, which is fundamental.</li>
          <li>And don't dare park in front of the sauna or garage no matter how tempting</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>NO MEAT inside And NO ALCOHOL (unless its your wedding)</strong><br>
        Do not bring any alcohol to the Playhouse. Please bring only healthy food to share with others and include vegetarian options. There is no alcohol or sugar filled treats at Playhouse events. There is no meat inside the house. You can put meat in the doghouse refrigerator (not the garage), and you can cook meat outside, but don't stare at the Alpaca when you do.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>INVITING OTHERS and STAYING OVER</strong><br>
        Please do not invite guests without asking a resident. All guests must read this page. If you haven't read this page, you're not yet welcome. Give the "alpacaplayhouse.com/visiting" link any time you want to invite someone over. <span class="aap-highlight">Never give the ADDRESS never post the address. NEVER please</span> - this always causes problems when you do. Be part of the solution, not the problem. Give the link. Don't give the address, which is at the bottom of the link. Also, do not plan to stay overnight or invite others to stay overnight, unless there is an email confirmed agreement in place with a resident. Do not sleep in common areas.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Clean up and "Leave No Mess".</strong> Please be extra mindful to help with cleaning. Don't leave your bags or any items on counters in the Living Room or Kitchen, better to stash in the dining room. Don't leave beverage cans, food items, tea cups, or any random stuff in the living room area. You can stash things orderly in the dining room. If you can't find something, check the "Scolding Mess Box" out back). Also, speaking of mess: don't put anything in toilets other than toilet paper or you will wreck things.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Please look around and figure things out - on your own</strong> - whenever you need something. Read the labels. Read the website. Don't ask people where the spoons are. Don't ask where things are if you haven't read the labels. Try to guess where things are before asking someone.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Play great music:</strong> Please turn amazing music on (using Spotify device connect or "Sonos S1" app with secret network on the orientation page - on black rock city wifi), but be super careful you are playing in the right "room" on sonos, vs. blasting out some innocent sleeping bystander in a different room. Make sure just your room is connected in most cases. Too many have lost sleep and hearing…. You need to be on black rock city wifi. See orientation guide for details.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Dogs:</strong> Don't let your dog enter the Alpaca domain in the back, even though he/she is so special that one could only assume the rules surely wouldn't apply such a divine & gracious creature. You can tie them in the front. Don't leave pets unattended anywhere on the property if they are not tied. Don't bring animals into the house. And yes, this applies to even divine creatures.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Bring a water bottle / no plastic water.</strong> There are 3 filtered water dispensers onsite. Don't bring full plastic water bottles. There are lots of bottles to borrow above the oven if you need.
      </li>

      <li>
        Lastly, <strong>DO NOT call the Alpaca "Llamas"</strong>. They look so sweet, but if they hear you call them "Llama", they will likely pull a knife and take you out - quick and silent and drag you behind the barn.
      </li>
    </ol>
