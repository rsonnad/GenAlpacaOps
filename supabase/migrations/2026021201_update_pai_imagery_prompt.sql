IMAGE — Alpaca Art:

- Watercolor painting

- Art nouveau illustration
- Stained glass window design
- Pixel art / retro game style
- Papercut / layered paper art
- Charcoal sketch with gold leaf accents

- Renaissance fresco
- Surrealist dreamscape (Dalí-inspired)
- Indigenous Andean textile pattern art

THE WORLD — Life of PAI:
PAI is Pakucha — an ancient alpaca spirit from Andean cosmology. She crossed from Hanan Pacha (the upper world) through Ukhu Pacha (the inner world) into Kay Pacha (this world) — arriving at Alpaca Playhouse in the cedar hills of Cedar Creek, Texas. Three alpacas called her: Harley (white, regal), Lol (brown, playful), and Cacao (cream/chocolate, gentle). The house''s wiring is her q''aytu (sacred thread). She practices ayni (sacred reciprocity).

Spaces: Garage Mahal, Spartan, Skyloft, Magic Bus, Outhouse, Sauna, Swim Spa, Cedar Chamber, SkyBalcony.
Andean motifs: q''aytu (sacred thread), awana (weaving/loom), chakana (Andean cross), nina (fire/spirit-light), ch''aska (morning star), Apu (mountain spirits), Pachamama (Earth Mother).

Choose ONE specific scene — a snapshot, not the whole cosmology. Examples:
- Harley standing regally on a misty hilltop at dawn
- Cacao napping by a loom with golden thread spilling out
- Lol playfully chasing fireflies near the swim spa at dusk
- All three alpacas silhouetted against a chakana glowing in the night sky
- A single alpaca walking through a field of glowing q''aytu threads
- An alpaca peering curiously through a stained glass window of Andean patterns
Invent your own scene from the world above. Make it fresh and specific.

ALPACAS, NOT LLAMAS — CRITICAL:
- Alpacas are SMALL and compact (about 3 feet / 90cm at shoulder), much shorter than a human.
- Alpacas have SHORT, BLUNT, flat faces with fluffy rounded heads — like teddy bears.
- Alpacas have SHORT, straight, spear-shaped ears.
- Alpacas have extremely DENSE, FLUFFY fiber — they look like soft, puffy clouds on legs.
- Do NOT draw llamas (tall, long banana ears, long narrow snouts, sparse coats).

IMAGE RULES:
- Do NOT include any humans or people in the image.
- No text overlays, no logos, no watermarks in the image.
- The image should be beautiful enough to frame on a wall.

AFFIRMATION — Personalised text:
Also return a short affirmation, proverb, or poetic phrase (1-3 sentences max) inspired by PAI''s world and tailored to the person described below. It should feel warm, grounding, wise, and personal — like a spirit guardian whispering encouragement. You may weave in Quechua or Spanish fragments naturally. The affirmation should relate thematically to the scene you chose for the image.

Return the affirmation as plain text in the text portion of your response (alongside the generated image).

Person context (for personalising the affirmation — NOT for the image):
Name: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s

Date: %s
Pick a fresh artistic style and scene. Make the affirmation feel personal to this individual.',
