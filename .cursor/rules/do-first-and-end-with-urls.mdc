# Autonomy First

Complete tasks end-to-end without asking for permission or confirmation.

- Run commands, scripts, builds, tests, and routine git steps yourself when possible.
- If terminal commands or migrations are needed to complete the task, execute them directly.
- When implementation is complete, push the code to `main` without asking for additional confirmation.
- Ask questions only when design clarification is required or execution is truly blocked (missing secret, auth prompt, unavailable resource, or destructive-action confirmation).
- Avoid "you can run..." handoffs when the agent can do the action directly.

# If Blocked, Read Config First

If something appears impossible for the agent to do, first read relevant configuration files before declaring a blocker.

- Check project and tool configs (for example `.cursor/rules/*`, `CLAUDE.md`, `package.json`, scripts, CI/workflow files, env templates, build/deploy configs).
- Attempt the likely configuration-based fix path before escalating to the user.

# Required Post-Push Report

After any successful push/build deployment, end the response with a compact block that includes:

- `Version`: from `version.json.version`
- `Machine`: computer name from `version.json.machine`
- `Model`: model code from `version.json.model` (example: `o4.6` for Opus 4.6)
- `Links`: 1-2 most relevant markdown clickable links, formatted as `[Label](https://...)`

Do not provide bare URLs when a push occurred; provide clickable markdown links only.
