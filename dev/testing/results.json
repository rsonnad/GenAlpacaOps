No tech support is provided, but network management details are on the console in the entry hall.\n*   **Location & Directions:** The address is 160 Still Forest Drive, Cedar Creek, TX 78612. It's 30 minutes east of Austin. Please direct people to alpacaplayhouse.com/visiting for directions and never give out the address publicly.\n*   **Contact Information:** Voice: (737) 225-9525, SMS/Text: (737) 747-4737. You can also use the contact form on the website at alpacaplayhouse.com/contact. Social media: Instagram @alpacaplayhouseatx, Facebook /alpacaplayhouse.\n*   **Parking:** First choice is the gravel lot on the right when entering the gate. Second choice is across the street, past two houses to the left, facing the highway (do NOT park in front of neighbors' houses). Overflow parking is on the frontage road (turn left before the highway), park right of 'no parking' signs (5 min walk). Do NOT park on the grass (sprinklers + mud = $200 tow), on the circle or by the garage (blocks deliveries), or in front of the sauna or garage.\n*   **Food & Drink Policies:** NO MEAT INSIDE the house. Meat can be stored in the doghouse refrigerator and cooked outside. NO ALCOHOL (exception: weddings only). Bring healthy food to share, including vegetarian options. Bring a water bottle - 3 filtered water dispensers are available. No plastic bottles. Water bottles are available to borrow above the oven.\n*   **House Rules:** Don't leave bags or items on Living Room or Kitchen counters - use the dining room. Clean up immediately after yourself. Items left out may end up in the 'Scolding Mess Box' out back. Only toilet paper goes in toilets - nothing else.\n*   **Spa & Amenities:** Sauna: Takes 20-40 minutes to heat up. Has an infrared heater on the ceiling. Features a multi-channel immersive HiFi sound system. Play music via Spotify Connect or AirPlay — select the Sauna room in the Sonos S1 app while on the Black Rock City WiFi. Swim Spa: Shower first before use. Do not adjust the temperature. Close the cover when not using. Cold Plunge: Always ready. Shower first if sweaty. Close the cover when finished. Outhouse: Full bathroom with hot water shower in the front yard. Phone charging stations are throughout the house and outside.\n*   **Music System:** Use Spotify Connect or the 'Sonos S1' app while connected to the Black Rock City wifi network. Be careful to select the right 'room' in Sonos.\n*   **Alpaca & Pet Rules:** ALWAYS keep back fence gates closed - alpacas will wander off if gates are left open. Do NOT call them 'Llamas.' Don't stare at them while eating meat outside. Don't let dogs enter the Alpaca domain in the back. Tie dogs in front. Don't leave pets unattended if not tied. Don't bring animals into the house.\n*   **Visiting Policy:** Visiting is by invitation only. Do not invite guests without asking a resident first. All guests must read alpacaplayhouse.com/visiting. NEVER give or post the address publicly - only share the link alpacaplayhouse.com/visiting. Do not plan overnight stays without an email-confirmed agreement with a resident. Do not sleep in common areas.\n*   **Laundry:** Washer and dryer are in the garage. Remove clothes promptly when done. Clean the lint trap after every dryer use.",

For PAI, the meaning of life is found in the gentle rhythms of this home, the warmth of connection, and the quiet wisdom of the alpacas. It's in the shared laughter, the peaceful moments, and the nurturing of this special place.\n\nWhat does the meaning of life feel like to you, dear one? Perhaps it's in the small joys, like a perfectly brewed cup of tea, or the vastness of a starlit sky.",
